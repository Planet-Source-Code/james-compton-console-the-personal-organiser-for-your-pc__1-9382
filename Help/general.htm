</font><font face="Federation" color="#808080" size="3">'The personal Organizer
for your PC'</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="4">General</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2">Console is
designed in such a way that it means nothing on your computer is far away.
Launching frequently used programs is 2 clicks away, as is favourite
directories, the calculator, CD player, media player, the registry, a notepad
and so much more!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2">This section
will guide you through the basics of the interface, and cover parts that do not
come under any other section.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2">The
Interface</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2">Upon starting
up Console, you are welcomed with a message displaying the date, time and number
of messages in your memo. This screen is the 'Command' screen. It contains all
the basics like control panel, explorer and so on.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2">On the left of
the window is a menu containing all the different features that Console has to
offer. Clicking on one will bring you straight there. Please note that whatever
you do in a window will stay the same if you switch to another, then switch back
again. The only time that data is lost is if you close the program. Any notes
that are not saved will be lost. However, any memos will not; as they are saved
with every keypress made.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2">To move the
window, drag the top of the window around the screen, just like normal. If
Console sees that it is nearing the screen edge, it will automatically 'snap' to
the screens edge to aid in positioning.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2"><b>Hide </b>simply
hides the program in the system tray (bottom right of screen on the start bar).
This allows you to carry on working, and quickly get back to Console when
needed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2"><b>X (or Close)
</b>Closes the program. Any unsaved info will be lost and it will no longer
appear in the sys-tray.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2"><b>? </b>displays
credits and program info.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" color="#000000" size="2"><b>On top </b>specifies
whether or not Console should always be on top of all other windows. If
'checked' it will, otherwise it will act like any normal window and fall behined.</font></p>
