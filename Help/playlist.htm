<p align="left"><font face="Federation" size="2">Here you can create your own
playlists for use in the media player. It works with AVP playlists, which are
unique to this program. The great thing is that you can have videos in your
playlists too! The menu options are on the right of the playlist window. <b>'Add'</b>
adds all selected files from the file window to the playlist window. You can
also do this by double-clicking on the file in the file window. To select more
than one file at once, use SHIFT or CTL. while clicking. This only works with
the file window. <b>'Clear'</b> wipes all data that is in the playlist without
asking you to save before hand - so make sure you do! <b>'Move Up'</b> and <b>'Move
Down'</b> simply move the selected track up or down the playlist. Useful for
arranging it just how you want it.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" size="2"><b>'Transfer'</b> copies all
the playlist data from the list to the media player and starts playing at track
1 unless 'RND' was selected in the media player, in which case it will play a
random track.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Federation" size="2">Lastly, if you right click on a
file in the playlist, a small popup menu appears. The options are <b>'Play'</b>
or show <b>'Info'</b>. <b>'Play' </b>transfers the playlist to the media player,
then begins playing on the selected track even if 'RND' was selected. <b>'Info' </b>shows
a little message box with file details such as track number, total and full
filename.</font></p>
